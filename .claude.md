# Claude Development Notes

## UI/UX Preferences

### Modals and Confirmations
- **DO NOT use JavaScript alerts, confirms, or prompts** (e.g., `alert()`, `confirm()`, `prompt()`)
- **ALWAYS use modern, professional modal components** for user confirmations and interactions
- Use the `ConfirmationModalComponent` located at `src/app/components/ui/modal/confirmation-modal/`
- The confirmation modal supports:
  - Custom title and message
  - Primary and danger variants
  - Processing/loading states
  - Proper animations and accessibility
- Modals should have proper styling, animations, and accessibility features

### Implemented Confirmation Modals
✅ Club request approval - uses ConfirmationModalComponent
✅ Tournament deletion - uses ConfirmationModalComponent
✅ User deletion - uses ConfirmationModalComponent
